# streamwise_vorticity_budget

filter.py : 
Code used to filter the forward trajectories before they can be used in the budget.py code.

budget.py : 
Code used to calculate streamwise, crosswise, and vertical vorticity and the forcing terms along a trajectory. The forcing terms at each time step are saved in a .npy file for each term.
